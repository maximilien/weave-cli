# Release Notes - Weave CLI v0.1.9-rc3

**Release Date:** September 28, 2025

## üéØ Overview

This release focuses on improving user experience and fixing critical issues with empty collection handling. We've resolved confusing error messages and added important safety features for destructive operations.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Empty Collection Document Listing
- **Fixed**: Resolved the confusing "chunk_index" error when listing documents from empty collections
- **Improved**: Now shows clear "No documents found in collection 'X'" message
- **Enhanced**: Added robust fallback mechanisms using Weaviate's aggregation API
- **Maintained**: Full backward compatibility with collections containing documents

**Before:**
```bash
$ weave docs ls EmptyCollection
‚ùå Failed to list documents: collection EmptyCollection does not exist. Did you mean "chunk_index"?
```

**After:**
```bash
$ weave docs ls EmptyCollection
‚ö†Ô∏è  No documents found in collection 'EmptyCollection'
```

## ‚ú® New Features

### Double Confirmation for Delete-Schema Command
- **Added**: Double confirmation to `ds` (delete-schema) command, matching the `da` (delete-all) behavior
- **Enhanced**: Consistent safety experience across all destructive operations
- **Preserved**: `--force` flag still works to skip confirmations for scripting

**Confirmation Flow:**
1. **First confirmation**: Standard y/N prompt
2. **Second confirmation**: Red warning requiring exact "yes" input

```bash
$ weave cols ds MyCollection
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will permanently delete the schema for collection 'MyCollection'!

Are you sure you want to delete the schema for collection 'MyCollection'? (y/N): y

üö® FINAL WARNING: This operation CANNOT be undone!
The schema for collection 'MyCollection' will be permanently deleted.

Type 'yes' to confirm deletion: yes
‚úÖ Successfully deleted schema for collection: MyCollection
```
